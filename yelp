Yelp API Info and Workarounds
In the upcoming lecture, we will sign up for a Yelp developer account. As of March 2024, Yelp has paywalled its API. Additionally, they have moved the price endpoints into a premium tier:

https://docs.developer.yelp.com/page/start-your-free-trial

So, you can register for a free trial to get the API key, however, you will not have access to the pricing endpoints used in the course.

We would recommend using our personal API key which still returns all of the paywalled endpoints (for now):

Note - due to persistent abuse and usage by bots, this key is regularly rotated.

If you wish to use your own API key and free tier Yelp account, then, we have provided a solution to add dummy pricing data in this thread here (scroll past the video to see the featured question/response):

Yelp Registration Issues
Depending on your location, some students may be blocked from creating an account. There are a few things you can try.

Students noted a workaround in this thread using their phone which will show a captcha:

Using a VPN for registration and making API calls should also work. Students mentioned they were able to successfully sign up for an API key using the Opera Browser's built-in VPN feature. Other students mentioned that they were able to use Tunnelbear's free tier.

Lastly, you can try just using my key:

Note - due to persistent abuse and usage by bots, this key is regularly rotated.

Note - If some students try to use this in production or abuse the key in some way, you will start getting 429 errors (too many requests). There is a strict 5000 call per day quota - please only use this key for this course and to complete this project.
